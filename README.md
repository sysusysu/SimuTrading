# SimuTrading
The package is meant for the analysis and interpretation of trading behaviors carried out with multiple trading strategies.
The package provides a broker which, like a real one, close the deal for seller and buyer with a mutually agreed price.
This is from one of my early stages of exploring the stock market.
Have fun.
